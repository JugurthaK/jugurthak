👋 Hello, my name is Jugurtha, I'm 25 years old, living in France. I'm working as a devops at Orange, my goal is to deploy and maintain a web tracking application. I'm also involved in developing an internal tool using node and nuxt.

I'm currently finishing a CS degree at EPITA.

During my freetime, I love cycling and coding *surprisingly*
